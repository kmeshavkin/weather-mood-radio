# TO-DO
* Add usual music player elements (sound, previous/next - history + trackId required)
* Make state more readable
* Implement TAG_BLACKLIST?
* Somehow get clientId even when it was changed
* Make possible to select from more than first 200 songs
* Possibly find how to search only by title?  

# Legal Info
Streaming Sounds
Note if you are going to stream from our API you need to attribute properly. Make sure you've read our [Terms](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/terms-of-use) and [Attribution Guidelines](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/buttons-logos) to make sure you treat our creators content correctly. When using a custom player you must:

* Credit the uploader as the creator of the sound
* Credit SoundCloud as the source by including one of the logos found [here](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/buttons-logos)
* Link to the SoundCloud URL containing the work
* If the sound is private link to the profile of the creator

Will make an (i) icon with all the info in the player (+ check licensing and "all rights reserved" + fair use)

# Default

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
